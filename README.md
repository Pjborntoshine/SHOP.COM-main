# SHOP.COM



## CLONING OF OUT WEBSITE SHOP.COM

This blog is created to share our experience of working on a project assigned to us by Coding Ninja,which was to create a clone of the shop.com website in 10 days

## Our group consist of the following member:


- Prajwal Jawanjal.
 

## TECHNOLOGY STACK WE USED

* HTML.
* CSS.
* JAVASCRIPT.

## EXPECTATION:

i are expecting to create a pixel-perfect cloned site of shop.com website within four days. with all its pages,given proper HTML,CSS properties,using DOM and MEDIA QUERY concepts with respect to the official Shop.com website.

##  RESPONSIBITLIES:

1. I started by going through the website,studying its design,layouts,content etc.
2. I started to go with the first page first.We divided the main page into three parts the navigation bar, the body and the footer.
3. I worked on the navbar, sidebar and sign in and sign up page .
4. I worked on the body parts and footer part.
5. I worked on the add to cart functionality and created the pages that link with shop.com product.
6. I worked on the link clothing page and its functionality.
7. In the end we had to combine all the works together and upload on the GitHub.

## CHALLENGES I FACED AND HOW I SOLVED THEM:

As it was the first time for me, I encountered quite a few challenges while developing the clone. The challenges we can recall are as follows:

Git was entirely new to me, making it a challenge to merge the code on GitHub.

Another challenge involved solving issues with the JavaScript part of local storage. Occasionally, there were redundant classes, causing the output to become disoriented. Resolving this required a thorough check of class names and ID names. Effective communication among us was crucial to prevent it from happening again.

Since we haven't incorporated UI libraries yet, we faced numerous challenges in achieving a consistent layout across different screen sizes. Although we managed most of it, we discovered that this issue could be more efficiently resolved with the use of UI libraries. Consequently, we decided to move on and address other aspects.



## LETS HAVE LOOK FINAL OUTPUT OF OUT WEBSITE:
