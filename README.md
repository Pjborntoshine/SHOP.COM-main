# SHOP.COM



## CLONING OF OUT WEBSITE SHOP.COM

This blog is created to share our experience of working on a project assigned to us by Coding Ninja,which was to create a clone of the shop.com website in 10 days

## Our group consist of the following member:


- Prajwal Jawanjal.
 

## TECHNOLOGY STACK WE USED

* HTML.
* CSS.
* JAVASCRIPT.

## EXPECTATION:

expecting to create a pixel-perfect cloned site of shop.com website within four days. with all its pages,given proper HTML,CSS properties,using DOM and MEDIA QUERY concepts with respect to the official Shop.com website.

##  RESPONSIBITLIES:

1. I began by thoroughly examining the website, studying its design, layouts, and content.
2. Moving on, I started with the first page, breaking it down into three sections: the navigation bar, the body, and the footer.
3. My focus initially was on the navbar, sidebar, as well as the sign-in and sign-up pages.
4. Afterward, I addressed the body sections and the footer.
5. I implemented the "add to cart" functionality and created pages that linked with shop.com products.
6. My attention then shifted to the clothing page and its corresponding functionality.
7. Finally, I integrated all the components, ensuring they worked seamlessly together, and uploaded the project to GitHub.

## CHALLENGES I FACED AND HOW I SOLVED THEM:

As it was the first time for me, I encountered quite a few challenges while developing the clone. The challenges we can recall are as follows:

Git was entirely new to me, making it a challenge to merge the code on GitHub.

Another challenge involved solving issues with the JavaScript part of local storage. Occasionally, there were redundant classes, causing the output to become disoriented. Resolving this required a thorough check of class names and ID names. Effective communication among us was crucial to prevent it from happening again.

Since we haven't incorporated UI libraries yet, we faced numerous challenges in achieving a consistent layout across different screen sizes. Although we managed most of it, we discovered that this issue could be more efficiently resolved with the use of UI libraries. Consequently, we decided to move on and address other aspects.



## LETS HAVE LOOK FINAL OUTPUT OF OUT WEBSITE:
